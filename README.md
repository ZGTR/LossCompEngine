# Lossless Compression Engine

<br/><strong>Breif</strong>
<br/>This solution serves as an implementation of lossless compression algorithms in a Mulimedia Course I did back in 2011.

<strong>What you will find</strong>
<br/>In this solution you will find all of the compression and deompression algorithms of the following approaches:
<li/>RLE 1
<li/>RLE 2
<li/>RLE Quad Tree
<li/>LZ77 - Adaptive Dictionary
<li/>LZW
<li/>Arithmetic Coding
The previous approaches are widly discussed throughout the internet. Ntn more needed here.

<strong>User Interface</strong>
<br/>Inside the solution you can find a friendly user interface you can interact with and see how things are compressed/decompressed.

<br/>To show off how algorithms work, the user can manipulate images or texts through compression/ decompression:

<br/>For images, you can see the resultant compressed images to compare, etc.

<br/>A left panel shows details about how data is compressed and how much time it took:
